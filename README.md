# Zelda-Game
The tutorial is finished howeveer there are some problems i am not going to address. There was no end game mechanism. This could just be tied with the playe health stats and if it is less than just use pygame to kill the window or show a death screen. There is also no start gae mechanism, no welcome menu. Would be nice, just don;t feel like adding it. The objects look that way becuase i didn't find the actual sprite with the correct object. The last thing is there is an index out of bounds error when you attack the bushes. We iterate over the bush list and there is randomly a error. I can't eally figure this one out. But all in all Clear Codes Zelda tut was great. Very well explained, great exercises to do on your own, and an excellent starting point.
